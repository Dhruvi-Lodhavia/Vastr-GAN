About ADIDAS Own The Run T-shirt
The drawer is full of running T-shirts that didn't quite work out. Too thick, too thin. Too tight, too loose. But the one that always seems to find its way to the top of the pile is this Adidas Own the Run Tee. Made with recycled materials as part of our commitment to sustainability, it keeps you comfortable on a long loop on Sunday and a lunchtime 5K on Monday. Never settle for not-quite-right again.
